# Pentester Toolbox  

>The idea was to have a mobile "laptop" like setup using Raspberry Pi 5, running Kali Linux, with laptop screen in a toolbox containing my extra gadgets when I am on the road performing mobile security assessments.

# Penetration Testing Toolbox Content  

## 1. Dropbox  

>This is a device that is placed at the target office location using social engineering. It connects to their internal LAN network via Ethernet. The device includes a GSM SIM HAT board, which sends me an SMS when it is powered on, providing me with the GSM public IP address. This allows me to establish a remote SSH connection to the device. Additionally, the device broadcasts a rogue fake free WiFi access point to steal user credentials from those seeking quick, free wireless access.

>Equipment:
* Raspberry pi4
* GSM HAT SIM7600E with SIM card
* USB Battery bank for power source  

## 2. Wireless Sniffer  

>This module is build using the PwnAgotchi project and perform deauthentication, and handshake interception to obtain wireless password hashes.

>Equipment:  
* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* WaveShare 2.23 Inch OLED HAT display board

## 3. Bad USB  

>USB Arduino ATtiny85 boards loaded with various scripts and setup to bypass USB blocking protection on windows workstations.  
>The PowerShell scripts perform various actions similar to the HAK5 rubber ducky actions such as password stealer and downloading staged reverse shell from my "homecloud".

>Equipment:
* Digispark ATTiny85 DEV USB boards
* See ***code* folder for sample Arduino script

>Install Windows Digispark drivers and and install Digistump AVR Boards in IDE

>Note, to upload code to board, click upload button in Arduino IDE and only then plug into USB when message indicate in IDE console!

## 4. Fake USB Mouse  

>This unit is connected to windows workstation and provide direct access through USB bypassing security policy that prevent USB storage devices.  
>The device broadcast secure wireless AP that I connect to and then via the USB presents a keyboard that allow the execution of scripts remotely to execute payloads and reverse shell payloads downloaded in stages from my "homecloud".  
>This unit is setup from the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A project source.  

>Equipment:
* USB Mouse inside modified
* Raspberry Pi Zero W

## 5. Wireless Attacks & Control  

>This Rapsberry Pi5 with ALFA AWUS036AXML 802.11axe WiFi USB adapter is used as wireless attack station during wireless penetration testing.  
>This Pi5 is also used to connect to the other equipement such as my "homecloud" or the Fake USB mouse to issue remote commands.

>Equipment:  
* Raspberry Pi5 8GB
* Universal LCD Control Board with Cable - 30 Pin EDP
* LCD Laptop screen inside toolbox lid  
* ALFA AWUS036AXML 802.11axe WiFi USB adapter
* Pi5 Power supply on custom power lead

>The old repurposed LCD screen from laptop I needed a Universal LCD Control Board with Cable for 30 Pin EDP, in my case.
>Mounting the LCD is in progress, but inspiration from project [Open MenuRe-purposed Laptop Screen for Raspberry Pi by lerigsby12](https://www.instructables.com/Re-purposed-Laptop-Screen-for-Raspberry-Pi/).

## 6. Homecloud  

>The homecloud Raspberry pi 4 provide me private cloud controlled and maintained on my dedicated internet connection.  
>I can remotely control the power to the unit, thus it is only turned on and visible on public internet when I require payloads, reverse shell, fake impersonate web hosting or webhooks.
>Controlling the power and when it is visible on the public internet keep nosy scanners from my device unnessaryly.

>Equipement:  
* Raspberry Pi4 4GB
* Sonoff Smart Switch wireless
