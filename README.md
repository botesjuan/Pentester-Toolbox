>The content of my Penetration Testing Toolbox:

## 1. Dropbox 
>This is the unit through social engineering is dropped at target office location and the ethernet network connect to their internal LAN network.
>The unit consist of GSM SIM HAT board to give me SMS when it is powered on with the GSM public IP obtained providing me with remote SSH connection to device.
>The unit is also broadcast a rogue fake free Wifi AP to steal user credentials that is looking to get quick free wireless access.
>Equipment:
* Raspberry pi4
* GSM HAT SIM7600E with SIM card
* USB Battery bank for power source  

## 2. Wireless Sniffer
>This module is made using the PwnAgotchi project source and perform deauthentication, handshake interception to obtain wireless password hashes.
>Equipment:
* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* WaveShare 2.23 Inch OLED HAT display board

## 3. Bad USB   
>USB Arduino ATtiny85 boards loaded with various scripts and setup to bypass USB blocking protection on windows workstations.
>The PowerShell scripts perform various actions similar to the HAK5 rubber ducky actions such as password stealer and downloading staged reverse shell from my "homecloud"
>Equipment:
* Digispark ATTiny85 DEV USB boards

## 4. Fake USB Mouse
>This unit is connected to windows workstation and provide access through USB bypassing security policy that prevent USB storage devices.
>The USB presents a keyboard and allow the execution of scripts to execute payloads and reversh payloads hosted on my "homecloud"
>This is build from the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A project source.
>Equipment:
* USB Mouse inside modified
* Raspberry Pi Zero W

# 5. Wireless Attacks & Command and Control
>This Rapsberry Pi5 with ALFA AWUS036AXML 802.11axe WiFi USB adapter is used as wireless attack station during wireless penetration testing.
>This Pi5 is also used to connect to the other equipement such as my "homecloud" or the Fake USB mouse to issue remote commands.
>Equipment:
* Raspberry Pi5 8GB
* ALFA AWUS036AXML 802.11axe WiFi USB adapter
* Pi5 Power supply

# 6. Homecloud  
>The homecloud Raspberry pi 4 provide me private cloud controlled and maintained on my dedicated internet connection.
>I remotely control the power to the unit, this it is only turned on and visible on public internet when I require payloads, reverse shell, fake impersonate web hosting or webhooks.
>Equipement:
* Raspberry Pi4 4GB
* Sonoff Smart Switch wireless
